# Task 6 – Password Strength Evaluation

## Objective
 Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

---

## 1. Password Testing
Passwords were tested using:
- Kaspersky Password Checker
- PasswordMeter.com 

| Password               | Strength  | Feedback                                         |
|------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| sujith123              | Weak      | Too short, no symbols, easy to guess             |
| Sujith@123             | Medium    | Needs more length and variety                    |
| SuJ1th!2025$           | Strong    | Good length, uses all character types            |
| Thund3r$R@1n!Breeze^99 | Very Strong | Very long, high complexity, hard to brute force|

## 3. Common Password Attacks

1. **Brute Force Attack**  
   Attempts every possible character combination until the correct password is found.

2. **Dictionary Attack**  
   Uses a precompiled list of common words and phrases to guess passwords.

---

## 4. Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use at least **12–16 characters**.
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid personal details like names, DOB, or phone numbers.
- Use **passphrases** (e.g., `Thund3r$R@1n!Breeze^99`).
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
- Use a **password manager** for storage and generation.

## 5. Conclusion
Password complexity directly impacts resistance to brute force and dictionary attacks. Strong, long, and varied passwords significantly increase account security.  
By following best practices and regularly updating credentials, we can greatly reduce the risk of compromise.
